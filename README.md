# Image Keypoint Detection Kaggle Challenge

# Discuss

- how should this problem be posed?
- how do random forests work? prediction, learning
- what weaknesses does a random forest have for this challenge

# Tensor flow notes

## Operate
- start container : `make start_container`
- learn : `make run`

## Code structure
- Training loop in `nn_connected.py`
- NN defined in `nn_keypoints.py`

## Approach 

- Trying to implement a perceptron and get a comparable result to the linear approach
